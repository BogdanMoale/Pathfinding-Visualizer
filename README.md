# Pathfinding-Visualizer

This project is a web-based pathfinding visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interactively explore and visualize various pathfinding algorithms as they navigate through mazes. The goal of the project is to provide a hands-on way to understand and observe how different algorithms work in finding the shortest path between two points in a grid-based environment.

# Features
* Interactive grid-based maze generation.
* Visualization of pathfinding algorithms:
** Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Real-time visualization of algorithm decision-making.
* Ability to generate random mazes with obstacles.

# Algorithms
## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes in layers. It starts from the initial node (start point) and explores all neighbors before moving to the next level of nodes. This ensures the shortest path is found.
